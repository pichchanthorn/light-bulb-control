# 💡 Light Bulb Control – jQuery DOM Project

A clean and interactive front-end project that demonstrates how to control a **light bulb ON and OFF** using **jQuery DOM manipulation**.  
This project focuses on practicing UI interactions, DOM events, and writing clean, well-structured front-end code with basic web technologies.

- jQuery DOM manipulation  
- Event handling  
- UI state management  
- Professional front-end project structure
